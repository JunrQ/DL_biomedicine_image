    Note: All the fully_connected layers have been transformed to conv2d layers.
          To use in classification mode, resize input to 224x224.
    Args:
      inputs: a tensor of size [batch_size, height, width, channels].
      num_classes: number of predicted classes.
      is_training: whether or not the model is being trained.
      dropout_keep_prob: the probability that activations are kept in the dropout
        layers during training.
      spatial_squeeze: whether or not should squeeze the spatial dimensions of the
        outputs. Useful to remove unnecessary dimensions for classification.
      scope: Optional scope for the variables.
      fc_conv_padding: the type of padding to use for the fully connected layer
        that is implemented as a convolutional layer. Use 'SAME' padding if you
        are applying the network in a fully convolutional manner and want to
        get a prediction map downsampled by a factor of 32 as an output.
        Otherwise, the output prediction map will be (input / 32) - 6 in case of
        'VALID' padding.
    Returns:
      the last op containing the log predictions and end_points dict.
